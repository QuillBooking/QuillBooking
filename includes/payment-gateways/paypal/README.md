# PayPal Payment Gateway for QuillBooking

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

### Payment Verification

The PayPal webhook verification was improved to fix a bug where the `mode_settings` parameter was not properly accepted or used in the `validate_ipn` method. The following improvements were made:

1. Fixed the `validate_ipn` method signature to accept and use `$mode_settings` parameter
2. Added verification of the receiver email to ensure it matches the configured PayPal email
3. Added detailed error logging for webhook validation failures
4. Fixed conditional verification based on the `disable_verification` setting
5. Improved the handling of transaction IDs in all payment statuses

### Additional Verification

Added additional verification checks throughout the webhook processing:

1. Transaction ID validation in completed payments
2. Amount verification to ensure payment amount matches the order total
3. Better tracking of transaction IDs for all payment statuses
4. Improved error logging for debugging payment issues

### Testing

A new testing utility has been added: `test-webhook.php`. This can be used to manually test the PayPal webhook functionality:

1. Navigate to the PayPal Webhook Test page in the admin
2. Configure the test parameters (payment status, amount, etc.)
3. Submit the form to simulate a PayPal webhook event
4. Check the logs to verify the webhook was processed correctly

## How Verification Works

The PayPal webhook verification now works like this:

1. First, it checks if verification is disabled in the settings
2. If verification is enabled, it verifies that the receiver email matches the configured email
3. It then sends the IPN data back to PayPal for validation
4. Finally, it logs the result of the validation

This ensures that all incoming payments are properly verified before being processed.
